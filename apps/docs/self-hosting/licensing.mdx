Rallly is open-source and always free for personal use.
If you want to run a multi-user setup, we ask that you purchase a license key.

## Activating Your License

Once you have your license key, you can activate it in your self-hosted Rallly instance:

1.  Log in to your Rallly instance as an administrator.
2.  Navigate to the [Control Panel](/self-hosting/control-panel).
3.  Select **License**.
4.  Enter your license key in the provided field and click **Activate**.

Your instance will now be licensed for multi-user access according to your chosen tier.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="What constitutes a user?">
Only individuals with a **registered user account** on your Rallly instance count towards your user limit. People who participate in polls without being registered (i.e., guest voters) **do not** count as users for licensing purposes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my user limit?">
We operate an **honor system** for user limits. If you exceed your user limit, your instance will continue to function without any interruption. You'll simply see a friendly reminder asking you to upgrade to a higher tier.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get an invoice?">
For Plus and Organization tiers, you'll automatically receive a payment receipt via email right after your purchase. This receipt contains all the necessary transaction details for your accounting and tax purposes. Formal invoices are a feature specifically included with our Enterprise tier. If you have any questions about your receipt, or if you're an Enterprise customer needing an invoice, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact/support).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get a refund?">
Our license keys provide perpetual access and cannot be "returned".
Due to the nature of these licenses and the costs associated with processing transactions, we are unable to offer refunds.
Issuing a refund would mean we incur a financial loss while you retain the perpetual license.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does an Enterprise license cost?">
The Enterprise license is designed for organizations with more than 50 users.

- **Base fee:** $499 (includes up to 50 users)
- **Additional users:** $5 per user beyond the first 50
- **Offline activation (optional):** +30% surcharge, for environments without internet access

All licenses include access to updates and dedicated support. For a personalized quote or to discuss your requirements, please [contact us](mailto:support@rallly.co).

<Accordion title="Do you offer discounts for non-profit organizations?">
We offer a 50% discount for non-profit organizations. If you are a non-profit organization, please [contact us](/contact/support) to request a discount.
